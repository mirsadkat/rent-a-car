# rent-a-car
I've worked on this project with two of my colleagues Borna Nozic and Ajdin Dzananovic as part of our final exam.

The application consists of 3 modules: backend API, frontend UI and backoffice admin panel.

Unregistered users can view a list of cars with their characteristics and make a reservation and
also become registered users of the application. Registered users can make additional
reservations, modify or cancel them, as well as see the history of their own reservations. Search
for cars by brand, model and other characteristics is also enabled.

On the admin panel, depending on the authorization level, users / employees can add, delete and
modify car data, as well as view reservations data (all users), add and delete other users, and
determine the level of privileges (superadmin).

Used technologies PHP, Laravel, MySQL, AngularJS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
